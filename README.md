# This is my first Brick Breaker Game which I made in Java. The sole purpose of making this game was to get more familiarized with OOP and Java and also trying to improve my coding skills.

By the way, I know that I've done 4 rectangle objects when I should have done one two dimensional array. Maybe in the future I will modify the code.
